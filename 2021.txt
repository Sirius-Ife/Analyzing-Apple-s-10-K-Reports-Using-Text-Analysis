Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and year￾to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 
2019 are not included in this Form 10-K, and can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition 
and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended 
September 26, 2020.
Fiscal Year Highlights
COVID-19 Update
The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and 
businesses to take unprecedented measures, such as restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of 
businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global 
economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the 
measures taken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company’s business, 
results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company’s stock.
During 2021, aspects of the Company’s business continued to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many of the 
Company’s retail stores, as well as channel partner points of sale, temporarily closed at various times, and a significant number 
of the Company’s employees working remotely. The Company has reopened all of its retail stores and substantially all of its other 
facilities, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees and customers, and it 
continues to work on safely reopening the remainder of its facilities, subject to local rules and regulations. During the fourth 
quarter of 2021, certain of the Company’s component suppliers and logistical service providers experienced disruptions, resulting 
in supply shortages that affected sales worldwide. Similar disruptions could occur in the future.
The extent of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance is 
uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of 
the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and 
treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and 
demand for consumer products. Refer to Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors” for more information.
Fiscal 2021 Highlights
Total net sales increased 33% or $91.3 billion during 2021 compared to 2020, driven by growth in all Products and Services 
categories. Year-over-year net sales during 2021 also grew in each of the Company’s reportable segments.
In April 2021, the Company announced an increase to its current share repurchase program authorization from $225 billion to 
$315 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.205 to $0.22 per share beginning in May 2021. During 2021, the Company 
repurchased $85.5 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $14.5 billion.

Segment Operating Performance
The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the 
Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe 
includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong 
and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable 
segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is 
managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market 
dynamics of each geographic region. Further information regarding the Company’s reportable segments can be found in Part II, 
Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic 
Data.”
The following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2021, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in millions):
2021 Change 2020 Change 2019

Americas
Americas net sales increased during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone, Services and Mac.
Europe
Europe net sales increased during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone, Services and iPad. The 
movement of foreign currencies in Europe relative to the U.S. dollar had a net favorable impact on Europe net sales during 2021.
Greater China
Greater China net sales increased during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone, iPad and Services. 
The strength of the Chinese renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar had a favorable impact on Greater China net sales during 2021.
Japan
Japan net sales increased during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone and Services.
Rest of Asia Pacific

Gross Margin
Products and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (dollars in millions):
2021 2020 2019
Gross margin:
Products $ 105,126 $ 69,461 $ 68,887 
Services 47,710 35,495 29,505 
Total gross margin $ 152,836 $ 104,956 $ 98,392 
Gross margin percentage:
Products 35.3% 31.5% 32.2% 
Services 69.7% 66.0% 63.7% 
Total gross margin percentage 41.8% 38.2% 37.8% 
Products Gross Margin
Products gross margin increased during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to higher Products volume, a different Products 
mix and the strength in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Products gross margin percentage increased during 2021
compared to 2020 due primarily to a different Products mix, improved leverage and the strength in foreign currencies relative to 
the U.S. dollar.
Services Gross Margin
Services gross margin increased during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to higher Services net sales and a different 
Services mix. Services gross margin percentage increased during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to a different Services 
mix and improved leverage, partially offset by higher Services costs.
The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K 
under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and 
downward pressure.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses for 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (dollars in millions):
2021 Change 2020 Change 2019
Research and development $ 21,914 17 % $ 18,752 16 % $ 16,217 
Percentage of total net sales 6% 7% 6% 
Selling, general and administrative $ 21,973 10 % $ 19,916 9 % $ 18,245 
Percentage of total net sales 6% 7% 7% 
Total operating expenses $ 43,887 13 % $ 38,668 12 % $ 34,462 
Percentage of total net sales 12% 14% 13% 
Research and Development
The year-over-year growth in R&D expense in 2021 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses, R&D￾related professional services and infrastructure-related costs. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in 
R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated 
products and services that are central to the Company’s core business strategy.
Selling, General and Administrative
The year-over-year growth in selling, general and administrative expense in 2021 was driven primarily by increases in 
headcount-related expenses, variable selling expenses and professional services.
Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 23
Other Income/(Expense), Net
Other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”) for 2021, 2020 and 2019 was as follows (dollars in millions):
2021 Change 2020 Change 2019
Interest and dividend income $ 2,843 $ 3,763 $ 4,961 
Interest expense (2,645) (2,873) (3,576) 
Other income/(expense), net 60 (87) 422 
Total other income/(expense), net $ 258 (68) % $ 803 (56) % $ 1,807 
The year-over-year decrease in OI&E during 2021 was due primarily to lower interest income and net losses on marketable 
securities, partially offset by positive fair value adjustments on non-marketable securities and lower interest expense on term 
debt.
Provision for Income Taxes
Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows 
(dollars in millions):
2021 2020 2019
Provision for income taxes $ 14,527 $ 9,680 $ 10,481 
Effective tax rate 13.3% 14.4% 15.9% 
Statutory federal income tax rate 21% 21% 21% 
The Company’s effective tax rate for 2021 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective 
tax rate on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation and foreign-derived intangible income deductions. The 
Company’s effective tax rate for 2020 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on 
foreign earnings, including the impact of tax settlements, and tax benefits from share-based compensation.
The Company’s effective tax rate for 2021 was lower compared to 2020 due primarily to higher tax benefits from foreign-derived 
intangible income deductions and share-based compensation and the favorable impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits, 
partially offset by a one-time adjustment in 2020 of U.S. foreign tax credits in response to regulations issued by the U.S. 
Department of the Treasury in December 2019.
During 2021, the Company established deferred tax assets (“DTAs”) for foreign tax credit carryforwards in Ireland and increased 
DTAs for R&D tax credit carryforwards in California, which resulted in a combined $3.5 billion increase in the valuation allowance 
on the Company’s DTAs, with no effect on net income. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, 
together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to realize substantially all of the 
Company’s remaining DTAs.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $172.6 billion
as of September  25, 2021, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be 
sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.
The Company’s material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations.
Debt
As of September 25, 2021, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate 
principal amount of $118.1 billion (collectively the “Notes”), with $9.6 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments 
associated with the Notes total $39.5 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months.
The Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper 
program. As of September 25, 2021, the Company had $6.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, all of which was payable 
within 12 months.
Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 24
Leases
The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including retail, corporate, manufacturing and data 
center space. As of September 25, 2021, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $14.6 billion, with $1.8 billion
payable within 12 months.
Manufacturing Purchase Obligations
The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform 
final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide 
variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information 
supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of September  25, 2021, the Company had 
manufacturing purchase obligations of $54.8 billion, with $54.7 billion payable within 12 months. The Company’s manufacturing 
purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable.
Other Purchase Obligations
The Company’s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including 
product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and noncancelable obligations related to advertising, content creation and 
Internet and telecommunications services. As of September  25, 2021, the Company had other purchase obligations of $8.3 
billion, with $4.8 billion payable within 12 months.
Deemed Repatriation Tax Payable
As of September 25, 2021, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 
2017 (the “Act”) was $24.6 billion, none of which is payable within 12 months.
In addition to its cash requirements, the Company has a capital return program authorized by the Board of Directors. The 
Program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. As of September 25, 2021, the Company’s 
quarterly cash dividend was $0.22 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to 
declaration by the Board of Directors.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles 
(“GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s 
management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the 
significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 
Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under 
the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.
Uncertain Tax Positions
The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company’s 
uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and 
international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. 
Although management believes the Company’s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome 
of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company’s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering 
changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination or the refinement of an estimate. Resolution of these 
uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial 
condition and operating results.
Legal and Other Contingencies
The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of 
which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount 
is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner 
inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating 
results.
Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 25

Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation and Preparation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” 
or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s 
management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary 
for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in 
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that 
affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the 
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s 
presentation.
The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is 
included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The 
Company’s fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, 
quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and 
periods of those fiscal years.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses
At the beginning of the first quarter of 2021, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (the “FASB”) 
Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit 
Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses on certain 
financial instruments. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. The adoption of 
ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
Share-Based Compensation
The Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on 
the date of grant, and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest. 
Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9, “Benefit Plans.”
Earnings Per Share
The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2021, 2020 and 2019 (net income in 
millions and shares in thousands):
2021 2020 2019
Numerator:
Net income $ 94,680 $ 57,411 $ 55,256 
Denominator:
Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 16,701,272 17,352,119 18,471,336 
Effect of dilutive securities 163,647 176,095 124,315 
Weighted-average diluted shares 16,864,919 17,528,214 18,595,651 
Basic earnings per share $ 5.67 $ 3.31 $ 2.99 
Diluted earnings per share $ 5.61 $ 3.28 $ 2.97 
Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 34
The Company applies the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities. Potentially 
dilutive securities representing 62 million shares of common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per 
share for 2019 because their effect would have been antidilutive.
Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities
All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.
The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The 
Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument’s underlying 
contractual maturity date. Unrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale are 
recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”). 
The Company’s investments in marketable equity securities are classified based on the nature of the securities and their 
availability for use in current operations. The Company’s marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with gains and 
losses recognized in other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”).
The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.
Inventories
Inventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, 
which for buildings is the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the building; between one and five years for machinery and 
equipment, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; and the shorter of lease term or useful life for 
leasehold improvements. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized on a straight-line basis over the 
estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from five to seven years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property 
and equipment was $9.5 billion, $9.7 billion and $11.3 billion during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Noncash investing activities involving property, plant and equipment resulted in a net decrease to accounts payable and other 
current liabilities of $2.9 billion during 2019.
Restricted Cash and Restricted Marketable Securities
The Company considers cash and marketable securities to be restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally restricted. The 
Company reports restricted cash as other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and determines current or non-current 
classification based on the expected duration of the restriction. The Company reports restricted marketable securities as current 
or non-current marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the classification of the underlying securities.
Derivative Instruments and Hedging
All derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting treatment for derivative 
gains and losses is based on intended use and hedge designation.
Gains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of cash flow hedge effectiveness are initially deferred 
in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged 
transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For options designated as 
cash flow hedges, the Company excludes time value from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes it on a 
straight-line basis over the life of the hedge in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates. 
Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI.
Gains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of fair value hedge effectiveness are recognized in 
the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates along with offsetting losses and gains related to 
the change in value of the hedged item. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as fair value hedges, the Company 
excludes the forward carry component from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes it in OI&E on a straight-line 
basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are 
recognized in OCI.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges 
are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line items to which the derivative instruments relate.
Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 35
The Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The 
Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments as operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash 
Flows.
Fair Value Measurements
The fair values of the Company’s money market funds and certain marketable equity securities are based on quoted prices in 
active markets for identical assets. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company’s debt instruments 
and all other financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market 
prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
Note 2 – Revenue Recognition
Net sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue 
at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is 
generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of 
ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control 
transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are 
delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or 
commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.
The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer 
incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience.
For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the 
Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). 
When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are 
established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they 
were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers 
multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation 
including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, 
product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.
The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, 
Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated 
sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to 
receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud®, Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the 
right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with 
each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative 
SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is 
based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized 
when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the 
product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis 
over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software, 
including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled 
services and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost of sales as incurred.
For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For 
these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that 
any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized 
revenue, and has elected not to disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.
For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the 
Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when 
determining whether it obtains control of third-party products including, but not limited to, evaluating if it can establish the price of 
the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For 
third-party applications sold through the App Store and certain digital content sold through the Company’s other digital content 
stores, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company 
accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.
The Company has elected to record revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, 
with the collected taxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.

other agreements.
Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 38
The Company may sell certain of its marketable debt securities prior to their stated maturities for reasons including, but not 
limited to, managing liquidity, credit risk, duration and asset allocation. The following table shows the fair value of the Company’s 
non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of September 25, 2021 (in millions):
Due after 1 year through 5 years $ 83,755 
Due after 5 years through 10 years 23,915 
Due after 10 years 20,207 
Total fair value $ 127,877 
The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal 
loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit 
exposure to any one issuer. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio.
Derivative Instruments and Hedging
The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. 
However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, 
accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the 
hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.
Foreign Exchange Risk
To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, 
option contracts or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally 
hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 
12 months.
To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency 
exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company 
designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 25, 2021, the Company’s hedged term 
debt– and marketable securities–related foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized within 21 years.
The Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins 
from certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains 
and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.
Interest Rate Risk
To protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into 
interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value 
hedges.
The notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020
were as follows (in millions):
2021 2020
Derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges:
Foreign exchange contracts $ 76,475 $ 57,410 
Interest rate contracts $ 16,875 $ 20,700 
Derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges:
Foreign exchange contracts $ 126,918 $ 88,636 
The gross fair values of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities were not material as of September  25, 2021 and 
September 26, 2020.
The gains and losses recognized in OCI and amounts reclassified from AOCI to net income for the Company’s derivative 
instruments designated as cash flow hedges were not material in 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 39
The carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020

Current and non-current marketable securities $ 15,954 $ 16,270 
Current and non-current term debt $ (17,857) $ (21,033) 
The gains and losses on the Company’s derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges and the related hedged item 
adjustments were not material in 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Accounts Receivable
Trade Receivables
The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, 
resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does 
not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain 
instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit 
insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit￾financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company 
generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.
As of both September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company had no customers that individually represented 10% or 
more of total trade receivables. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 42% of total trade receivables as of 
September 25, 2021.
Vendor Non-Trade Receivables
The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to 
these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these 
components directly from suppliers. As of September 25, 2021, the Company had three vendors that individually represented 
10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 52%, 11% and 11%. As of September 26, 2020, the 
Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 
57% and 11%.

liabilities were (in millions):
2021 2020
Deferred tax assets:

Other 512 705 
Total deferred tax liabilities 7,200 10,138 
Net deferred tax assets $ 13,073 $ 8,157 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax credits and the future income tax effects of temporary differences 
between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, 
and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are 
expected to be recovered or settled. The Company has elected to record certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection 
with the minimum tax on certain foreign earnings created by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”).
As of September  25, 2021, the Company had $2.6  billion in foreign tax credit carryforwards in Ireland and $1.6  billion in 
California research and development credit carryforwards, both of which can be carried forward indefinitely. A valuation 
allowance has been recorded for the tax credit carryforwards and a portion of other temporary differences.
Uncertain Tax Positions
As of September  25, 2021, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $15.5 billion, of which $6.6 billion, if 
recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. As of September 26, 2020, the total amount of gross unrecognized 
tax benefits was $16.5 billion, of which $8.8 billion, if recognized, would have impacted the Company’s effective tax rate.
The aggregate change in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for 2021, 2020
and 2019, is as follows (in millions):
2021 2020 2019
Beginning balances $ 16,475 $ 15,619 $ 9,694 
Increases related to tax positions taken during a prior year 816 454 5,845 
Decreases related to tax positions taken during a prior year (1,402) (791) (686) 
Increases related to tax positions taken during the current year 1,607 1,347 1,697 
Decreases related to settlements with taxing authorities (1,838) (85) (852) 
Decreases related to expiration of the statute of limitations (181) (69) (79) 
Ending balances $ 15,477 $ 16,475 $ 15,619 
The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign 
jurisdictions. Tax years after 2015 for the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and after 2014 in certain major foreign jurisdictions, remain 
subject to examination. Although the timing of resolution and/or closure of examinations is not certain, the Company believes it is 
reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next 12 months by as much as $1.2 billion.
Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 42
Interest and Penalties
The Company includes interest and penalties related to income tax matters within the provision for income taxes. As of 
September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $1.5 billion and $1.4 
billion, respectively. The Company recognized interest and penalty expense of $219 million, $85 million and $73 million in 2021, 
2020 and 2019, respectively.
European Commission State Aid Decision
On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by 
providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the 
Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the 
Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated 
the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion, plus interest of 
€1.2 billion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the 
European Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 
2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice. The Company 
believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable 
against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act.
On an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for 
certain taxes paid to other countries. As of September  25, 2021, the adjusted recovery amount was €12.7 billion, excluding 
interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use 
pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings. Refer to the Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities section of Note 
3, “Financial Instruments” for more information.
Note 6 – Leases
The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including retail, corporate, manufacturing and data 
center space. These leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multiyear renewal 
options, some of which are reasonably certain of exercise. The Company’s lease arrangements may contain both lease and 
nonlease components. The Company has elected to combine and account for lease and nonlease components as a single lease 
component for leases of retail, corporate, and data center facilities.
Payments under the Company’s lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are primarily based 
on purchases of output of the underlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the Company’s operating 
leases were $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion for 2021 and 2020, respectively. Lease costs associated with variable payments on the 
Company’s leases were $12.9 billion and $9.3 billion for 2021 and 2020, respectively. Rent expense for operating leases, as 
previously reported under former lease accounting standards, was $1.3 billion in 2019.
The Company made $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion of fixed cash payments related to operating leases in 2021 and 2020, 
respectively. Noncash activities involving right-of-use (“ROU”) assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities were $3.3 billion
for 2021 and $10.5 billion for 2020, including the impact of adopting FASB ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) in the first 
quarter of 2020.
The following table shows ROU assets and lease liabilities, and the associated financial statement line items, as of 
September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020 (in millions):

The weighted-average remaining lease term related to the Company’s lease liabilities as of September  25, 2021 and 
September 26, 2020 was 10.8 years and 10.3 years, respectively.
The discount rate related to the Company’s lease liabilities as of both September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020 was 2.0%. 
The discount rates are generally based on estimates of the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, as the discount rates implicit 
in the Company’s leases cannot be readily determined.
As of September  25, 2021, the Company had $1.1 billion of future payments under additional leases, primarily for corporate 
facilities and retail space, that had not yet commenced. These leases will commence between 2022 and 2023, with lease terms 
ranging from 3 years to 20 years.

securities at a specified time and amount (“Repos”). Due to the Company’s continuing involvement with the marketable 
securities, the Company accounted for its Repos as collateralized borrowings. The Company entered into $5.2 billion of Repos 
during 2020, all of which had been settled as of September 26, 2020.

To manage interest rate risk on certain of its U.S. dollar–denominated fixed- or floating-rate notes, the Company has entered into 
interest rate swaps to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates or the floating interest rates to fixed 
interest rates on a portion of these notes. Additionally, to manage foreign currency risk on certain of its foreign currency–
denominated notes, the Company has entered into foreign currency swaps to effectively convert these notes to U.S. dollar–
denominated notes.
The effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes, amortization of the discount or premium and, if 
applicable, adjustments related to hedging. The Company recognized $2.6 billion, $2.8 billion and $3.2 billion of interest expense 
on its term debt for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Note 8 – Shareholders’ Equity
Share Repurchase Program
As of September 25, 2021, the Company was authorized to purchase up to $315 billion of the Company’s common stock under a 
share repurchase program (the “Program”). During 2021, the Company repurchased 656 million shares of its common stock for 
$85.5 billion, including 36 million shares delivered under a $5.0 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement entered into in 
May 2021, bringing the total utilization under the Program to $254.1 billion as of September 25, 2021. The Program does not 
obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the Program, shares may be repurchased in privately 
negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).

Note 9 – Benefit Plans
2014 Employee Stock Plan
The 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan that provides for broad-based equity grants to 
employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of restricted stock units (“RSUs”), stock grants, performance￾based awards, stock options and stock appreciation rights, as well as cash bonus awards. RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan 
generally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s 
common stock on a one-for-one basis. RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under 
the plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding 
obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the 2014 Plan utilizing a factor of two times the number of 
RSUs canceled or shares withheld. All RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan have dividend equivalent rights (“DERs”), which 
entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DERs are subject to the same vesting 
and other terms and conditions as the underlying RSUs. As of September  25, 2021, approximately 760 million shares were 
reserved for future issuance under the 2014 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2003 Employee Stock Plan 
that expire, are canceled or otherwise terminate, or are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations for RSUs, will also be 
available for awards under the 2014 Plan.
Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan
The Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (the “Director Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan that (i)  permits the 
Company to grant awards of RSUs or stock options to the Company’s non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial 
grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board of Directors and automatic annual grants of RSUs at each 
annual meeting of shareholders, and (iii) permits the Board of Directors to prospectively change the value and relative mixture of 
stock options and RSUs for the initial and annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the 
Company’s common stock subject to these grants, in each case within the limits set forth in the Director Plan and without further 
shareholder approval. RSUs granted under the Director Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a 
factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. The Director Plan expires on November 12, 2027. All RSUs granted under the 
Director Plan are entitled to DERs, which are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the underlying 
RSUs. As of September 25, 2021, approximately 4 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Director Plan.
Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans
During the three months ended September 25, 2021, Section 16 officers Katherine L. Adams, Timothy D. Cook, Luca Maestri, 
Deirdre O’Brien and Jeffrey Williams had equity trading plans in place in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange 
Act. An equity trading plan is a written document that preestablishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining 
the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company’s stock, including shares acquired under the 
Company’s employee and director equity plans.
Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 46
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Purchase Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan under which substantially all 
employees may voluntarily enroll to purchase the Company’s common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85%
of the lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the beginning or the end of six-month offering periods. An employee’s 
payroll deductions under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of the employee’s compensation and employees may not 
purchase more than $25,000 of stock during any calendar year. As of September 25, 2021, approximately 96 million shares were 
reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.
401(k) Plan
The Company’s 401(k) Plan is a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 
401(k) Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pretax earnings, up to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service
annual contribution limit ($19,500 for calendar year 2021). The Company matches 50% to 100% of each employee’s 
contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum of 6% of the employee’s eligible earnings.

The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $19.0 billion, $10.8 billion and $8.6 billion for 2021, 2020 and 
2019, respectively. The majority of RSUs that vested in 2021, 2020 and 2019 were net share settled such that the Company 
withheld shares with a value equivalent to the employees’ obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and 
remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 53 million, 56 million and 59 
million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as 
determined by the Company’s closing stock price. Total payments for the employees’ tax obligations to taxing authorities were 
$6.8 billion, $3.9 billion and $3.0 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., 
the U.K. and China mainland. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified 
amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a 
guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the 
guarantee liability recognized within net sales.
Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product
Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain 
components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with 
other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many 
components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide 
shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.
The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by 
the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new 
technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have 
increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to 
concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.
The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the 
Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.
Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in 
Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.
Unconditional Purchase Obligations
The Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services 
(“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for 
content creation, Internet and telecommunications services and supplier arrangements. Future payments under noncancelable 
unconditional purchase obligations having a remaining term in excess of one year as of September 25, 2021, are as follows (in 
millions):
2022 $ 4,551 
2023 2,165 
2024 984 
2025 405 
2026 51

Contingencies
The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that 
have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. When a loss related to a legal proceeding or claim 
is probable and reasonably estimable, the Company accrues its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of the matter. If one or 
more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the 
Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. In the 
opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a 
material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, except for the 
following matters:
VirnetX
VirnetX, Inc. (“VirnetX”) filed a lawsuit against the Company alleging that certain of the Company’s products infringe on patents 
owned by VirnetX. On April 11, 2018, a jury returned a verdict against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern 
District of Texas (the “Eastern Texas District Court”). The Company appealed the verdict to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
Federal Circuit, which remanded the case back to the Eastern Texas District Court, where a retrial was held in October 2020. 
The jury returned a verdict against the Company and awarded damages of $503 million, which the Company has appealed. The 
Company has challenged the validity of the patents at issue in the retrial at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO”), 
and the PTO has declared the patents invalid, subject to further appeal by VirnetX.
iOS Performance Management Cases
On April 5, 2018, several U.S. federal actions alleging violation of consumer protection laws, fraud, computer intrusion and other 
causes of action related to the Company’s performance management feature used in its iPhone operating systems, introduced to 
certain iPhones in iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2, were consolidated through a Multidistrict Litigation process into a single action in 
the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Northern California District Court”). On February 28, 2020, the 
parties in the Multidistrict Litigation reached a settlement to resolve the U.S. federal and California state class actions. On March 
18, 2021, the Northern California District Court granted final approval of the Multidistrict Litigation settlement, which will result in 
an aggregate payment of $310 million to settle all claims. The Company continues to believe that its iPhones were not defective, 
that the performance management feature introduced with iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2 was intended to, and did, improve 
customers’ user experience, and that the Company did not make any misleading statements or fail to disclose any material 
information.
French Competition Authority
On March 16, 2020, the French Competition Authority (“FCA”) announced its decision that aspects of the Company’s sales and 
distribution practices in France violate French competition law, and issued a fine of €1.1 billion. The Company strongly disagrees 
with the FCA’s decision, and has appealed.
Optis
Optis Wireless Technology, LLC and related entities (“Optis”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of 
Texas against the Company alleging that certain of the Company’s products infringe on patents owned by Optis. On August 11, 
2020, a jury returned a verdict against the Company and awarded damages. In post-trial proceedings, the damages portion of 
the verdict was set aside. A retrial on damages was held in August 2021 and the jury in that proceeding awarded damages of 
$300 million against the Company, which the Company plans to appeal.
Note 11 – Segment Information and Geographic Data
The Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the 
internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s 
reportable segments.
The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the 
Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe 
includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong 
and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable 
segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is 
managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market 
dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 
1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”
Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 49
The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for 
geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in 
those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and 
operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment 
in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain 
expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate 
expenses such as research and development, corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, 
income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company 
does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.
