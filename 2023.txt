 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons 
between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, 
and can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 
7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022.
Fiscal Period
The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is 
included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which 
occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021
spanned 52 weeks each.
Fiscal Year Highlights
The Company’s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023.
The Company’s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign 
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which 
consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services.
The Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant 
announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following:
First Quarter 2023: • iPad and iPad Pro;
• Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and
• MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service.
Second Quarter 2023: • MacBook Pro 14”, MacBook Pro 16” and Mac mini; and
• Second-generation HomePod.

• Apple Vision Pro™, the Company’s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS™, expected to be available in early 
calendar year 2024; and
• iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company’s operating systems.
Fourth Quarter 2023: • iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and
• Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2.

from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023. During 2023, the Company repurchased $76.6 billion of its common stock 
and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.0 billion.
Macroeconomic Conditions
Macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly 
impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.

dollar and lower Products volume, partially offset by cost savings and a different Products mix.
Products gross margin percentage increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to cost savings and a different Products mix, 
partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and decreased leverage.
Services Gross Margin
Services gross margin increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to higher Services net sales, partially offset by the 
weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and higher Services costs.
Services gross margin percentage decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher Services costs and the weakness in 
foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a different Services mix.
The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K 
under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and 
downward pressure.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions):
2023 Change 2022 Change 2021
Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 
Percentage of total net sales 8% 7% 6%

Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23
Provision for Income Taxes
Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows 
(dollars in millions):
2023 2022 2021
Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 
Effective tax rate 14.7% 16.2% 13.3% 
Statutory federal income tax rate 21% 21% 21% 
The Company’s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower 
effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&D credit, and tax benefits from share-based 
compensation, partially offset by state income taxes.
The Company’s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign 
earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially 
offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion
as of September  30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be 
sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.
The Company’s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations:
Debt
As of September  30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal 
amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the “Notes”), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments 
associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months.
The Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of 
September 30, 2023, the Company had $6.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months.
Leases
The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and 
retail space. As of September  30, 2023, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion
payable within 12 months.
Manufacturing Purchase Obligations
The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform 
final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide 
variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, 
with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable.
Other Purchase Obligations
The Company’s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including 
assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual 
property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 
billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months.
Deemed Repatriation Tax Payable
As of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 
2017 (the “Act”) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months.
Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24
Capital Return Program
In addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does 
not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company’s quarterly cash 
dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the 
Board of Directors.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles 
(“GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s 
management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the 
significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 
Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under 
the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.
Uncertain Tax Positions
The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company’s 
uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and 
international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. 
Although management believes the Company’s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of 
these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company’s reserves. Reserves are adjusted 
considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a 
manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and 
operating results.
Legal and Other Contingencies
The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of 
which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount 
is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner 
inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating 
results.

Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation and Preparation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The preparation of

to conform to the current period’s presentation.
The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is 
included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which 
occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and

Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 33
Note 2 – Revenue
The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is 
transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the 
significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s 
Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over 
time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer 
of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.
The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer 
incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience.
For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the 
Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). 
When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are 
established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they 
were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers 
multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation 
including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, 
product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.
The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, 
Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated 
sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to 
receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud®, Siri® and Maps. The third performance obligation is the 
right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with 
each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative 
SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is 
based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized 
when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the 
product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis 
over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.
For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For 
these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that 
any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized 
revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.
For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the 
Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when 
determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, 
retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party 
applications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the 
customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application–related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services 
net sales only the commission it retains.

(2) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.
Total net sales include $8.2 billion of revenue recognized in 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 24, 
2022, $7.5 billion of revenue recognized in 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 25, 2021, and $6.7 
billion of revenue recognized in 2021 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 26, 2020.
The Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment 
in Note 13, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for 2023, 2022 and 2021, except in Greater China, where iPhone 
revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.
As of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the Company had total deferred revenue of $12.1 billion and $12.4 billion, 
respectively. As of September 30, 2023, the Company expects 67% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 
25% within one-to-two years, 7% within two-to-three years and 1% in greater than three years.

(1) The valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of the Company’s Level 2 financial instruments, which generally 
have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant 
inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.

The following table shows the fair value of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of 
September 30, 2023 (in millions):
Due after 1 year through 5 years $ 74,427 
Due after 5 years through 10 years 9,964 
Due after 10 years 16,153 
Total fair value $ 100,544 
The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The 
Company classifies marketable debt securities as either current or non-current based solely on each instrument’s underlying 
contractual maturity date.
Derivative Instruments and Hedging
The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. 
However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations 
or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a 
portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.
The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments in the same section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash 
Flows as the items being hedged, which are generally classified as operating activities.
Foreign Exchange Rate Risk
To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other 
instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its 
forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.
To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign 
exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these 
instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 30, 2023, the maximum length of time over which the 
Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt–related foreign currency transactions is 19 
years.
The Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from 
certain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by 
the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.
Interest Rate Risk
To protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest 
rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.
The notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022
were as follows (in millions):
2023 2022
Derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges:
Foreign exchange contracts $ 74,730 $ 102,670

Interest rate contracts $ 1,367 $ — $ 1,367 
(1) Derivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and other non￾current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
(2) Derivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and other non￾current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The derivative assets above represent the Company’s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate 
credit risk, the Company generally uses collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when 
the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from contractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the 
Company generally uses master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, 
under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of 
September 24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including 
the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $7.8 billion, resulting in a net 
derivative asset of $412 million.
The carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022

Accounts Receivable
Trade Receivables
As of September 24, 2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which 
accounted for 10%. The Company’s third-party cellular network carriers accounted for 41% and 44% of total trade receivables as 
of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively. The Company requires third-party credit support or collateral from 
certain customers to limit credit risk.
Vendor Non-Trade Receivables
The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to 
these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these 
components directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in products net sales. Rather, 
the Company recognizes any gain on these sales as a reduction of products cost of sales when the related final products are 
sold by the Company. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of 
total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 48% and 23%. As of September  24, 2022, the Company had two
vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54% and 13%.

As of September  30, 2023, the Company had $5.2  billion in foreign tax credit carryforwards in Ireland and $3.0  billion in 
California R&D credit carryforwards, both of which can be carried forward indefinitely. A valuation allowance has been recorded 
for the credit carryforwards and a portion of other temporary differences.
Uncertain Tax Positions
As of September  30, 2023, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $19.5 billion, of which $9.5 billion, if 
recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. As of September 24, 2022, the total amount of gross unrecognized 
tax benefits was $16.8 billion, of which $8.0 billion, if recognized, would have impacted the Company’s effective tax rate.
The aggregate change in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for 2023, 2022
and 2021, is as follows (in millions):
2023 2022 2021
Beginning balances $ 16,758 $ 15,477 $ 16,475 
Increases related to tax positions taken during a prior year 2,044 2,284 816 
Decreases related to tax positions taken during a prior year (1,463) (1,982) (1,402)

Decreases related to settlements with taxing authorities (19) (28) (1,838) 
Decreases related to expiration of the statute of limitations (494) (929) (181) 
Ending balances $ 19,454 $ 16,758 $ 15,477 
The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign 
jurisdictions. Tax years after 2017 for the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and after 2014 in certain major foreign jurisdictions, remain 
subject to examination. Although the timing of resolution or closure of examinations is not certain, the Company believes it is 
reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next 12 months by as much as $4.5 billion.

European Commission State Aid Decision
On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by 
providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the 
Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the 
Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated 
the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion, plus interest of 
€1.2 billion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the 
European Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 
2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice (the “ECJ”) and a 
hearing was held on May 23, 2023. A decision from the ECJ is expected in calendar year 2024. The Company believes it would 
be eligible to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit for a portion of any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to 
the State Aid Decision.
On an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for 
certain taxes paid to other countries. As of September  30, 2023, the adjusted recovery amount was €12.7 billion, excluding 
interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use 
pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings. Refer to the Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities section of Note 
4, “Financial Instruments” for more information.
Note 8 – Leases
The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and 
retail space. These leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multiyear renewal options, 
some of which are reasonably certain of exercise.
Payments under the Company’s lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are primarily based 
on purchases of output of the underlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the Company’s operating 
leases were $2.0 billion, $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Lease costs associated with variable 
payments on the Company’s leases were $13.9 billion, $14.9 billion and $12.9 billion for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
The Company made $1.9 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.4 billion of fixed cash payments related to operating leases in 2023, 2022
and 2021, respectively. Noncash activities involving right-of-use (“ROU”) assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities were 
$2.1 billion, $2.8 billion and $3.3 billion for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The weighted-average remaining lease term related to the Company’s lease liabilities as of September  30, 2023 and 
September 24, 2022 was 10.6 years and 10.1 years, respectively. The discount rate related to the Company’s lease liabilities as 
of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 was 3.0% and 2.3%, respectively. The discount rates related to the Company’s 
lease liabilities are generally based on estimates of the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, as the discount rates implicit in 
the Company’s leases cannot be readily determined.
As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $544 million of future payments under additional leases, primarily for corporate 
facilities and retail space, that had not yet commenced. These leases will commence between 2024 and 2026, with lease terms 
ranging from 1 year to 21 years.
Note 9 – Debt
Commercial Paper
The Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses net 
proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of 
September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the Company had $6.0 billion and $10.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, 
respectively, with maturities generally less than nine months. The weighted-average interest rate of the Company’s commercial 
paper was 5.28% and 2.31% as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively. The following table provides a

Total non-current portion of term debt $ 95,281 $ 98,959 
To manage interest rate risk on certain of its U.S. dollar–denominated fixed-rate notes, the Company uses interest rate swaps to 
effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates on a portion of these notes. Additionally, to manage foreign 
exchange rate risk on certain of its foreign currency–denominated notes, the Company uses cross-currency swaps to effectively 
convert these notes to U.S. dollar–denominated notes.
The effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes, amortization of the discount or premium and, if 
applicable, adjustments related to hedging. The Company recognized $3.7 billion, $2.8 billion and $2.6 billion of interest expense 
on its term debt for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
The future principal payments for the Company’s Notes as of September 30, 2023, are as follows (in millions):

During 2023, the Company repurchased 471 million shares of its common stock for $76.6 billion, excluding excise tax due under 
the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The Company’s share repurchase programs do not obligate the Company to acquire a 
minimum amount of shares. Under the programs, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated or open market 
transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act.

2022 Employee Stock Plan
The Apple Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Plan (the “2022 Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan that provides for broad-based equity 
grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of RSUs, stock grants, performance-based awards, 
stock options and stock appreciation rights. RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan generally vest over four years, based on 
continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis. All 
RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan have dividend equivalent rights, which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value 
per share as holders of common stock. A maximum of approximately 1.3 billion shares were authorized for issuance pursuant to

The Apple Inc. 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan that provided for broad-based equity 
grants to employees, including executive officers. The 2014 Plan permitted the granting of substantially the same types of equity 
awards with substantially the same terms as the 2022 Plan. The 2014 Plan also permitted the granting of cash bonus awards. In 
the third quarter of 2022, the Company terminated the authority to grant new awards under the 2014 Plan.

withheld shares with a value equivalent to the employees’ obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and 
remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 37 million, 41 million and 53 
million for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as 
determined by the Company’s closing stock price. Total payments to taxing authorities for employees’ tax obligations were $5.6 
billion, $6.4 billion and $6.8 billion in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Note 12 – Commitments, Contingencies and Supply Concentrations
Unconditional Purchase Obligations
The Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services 
(“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of supplier 
arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. Future payments under noncancelable 
unconditional purchase obligations with a remaining term in excess of one year as of September 30, 2023, are as follows (in 
millions):
2024 $ 4,258 
2025 2,674 
2026 3,434 
2027 1,277 
2028 5,878 
Thereafter 3,215 
Total $ 20,736 
Contingencies
The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that 
have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at 
least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, 
concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.
Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product
Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain 
components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with 
other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many 
components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide 
shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.
The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by 
the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new 
technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have 
increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to 
concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.
Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in 
China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.

Note 13 – Segment Information and Geographic Data
The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the 
Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe 
includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong 
and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable 
segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is 
managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market 
dynamics of each geographic region.
The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for 
geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in 
those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment consists of net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and 
operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. The information provided to the Company’s chief operating decision 
maker for purposes of making decisions and assessing segment performance excludes asset information.
